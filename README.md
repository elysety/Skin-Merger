# Minecraft Skin Merger

**Made by Elysetra**

A small Java tool to merge Minecraft skins: it swaps the head (including the hat layer) from one skin onto the body of another. Perfect for creating custom characters or just experimenting with fun skin combinations.

## Features

- Merge heads from one skin onto another body
- Preview merged skin in a 2D viewer
- Save the merged skin as a `.png` file
- Automatically fetches Minecraft skins from Mojang servers
- Handles both **classic (64x32)** and **modern (64x64)** skin formats
- Safe and lightweight: does **not modify your system**, only manipulates images

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Internet connection (for fetching Minecraft skins)
- No additional libraries needed fully self-contained

## Usage

1. Download the latest release `.jar` file from this repository.
2. Run the tool with Java:

```bash
java -jar SkinMerger.jar
